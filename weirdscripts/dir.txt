https://fogcam.org: FogCam (The Oldest Webcam): Recognized as the world's oldest operating webcam still in existence. Started by students at San Francisco State University, it continues to broadcast live images of the campus, maintaining its original 1994 layout and low-resolution aesthetic.
https://edition.cnn.com: CNN - O.J. Simpson Trial Archive: An archived section of CNN dedicated to the "Trial of the Century." This sub-site features classic serif fonts, pixelated graphics, and a layout optimized for the slow dial-up connections of the era.
https://www.aliweb.com: ALIWEB (First Search Engine): Short for "Archie Like Indexing for the WEB," this was one of the internet's first search engines. While no longer a primary search tool, the site remains functional, allowing users to experience how people found information before Google existed.
https://www.3dcafe.com: 3-Dimensional Cafe: A quirky relic that showcases the early internet's fascination with 3D graphics and "virtual reality" (VRML). It is a simple, text-heavy site that represents the experimental nature of the web's first decade.
https://www.craigslist.org: Craigslist: Unlike others that are merely archives, Craigslist is a major modern site that has famously refused to change its minimalist, text-only 1990s design. In 2026, it remains a global hub for classified ads, proving that utility can outlast trends.
https://www.nd.edu: The Robert De Niro Page: A fan-made page from 1999 that has never been updated. It features a simple blue background, tiny images, and a guestbook, capturing the essence of personal web pages before social media.
https://archive.org: Wayback Machine (Internet Archive): The ultimate tool for browsing the old internet. It hosts billions of archived versions of sites that are no longer online, allowing you to "travel back in time" to any specific year.
