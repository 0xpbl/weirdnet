<h2>what is weirdnet?</h2>

<p>
  weirdnet is a human-edited map of the weird / small web — places you don’t find through algorithmic feeds.
  no dashboards, no growth hacks, no engagement bait.
</p>

<p>
  phase 1 ships two static islands:
  <a href="https://links.weirdnet.org/">drops</a> (a chronological link log) and
  <a href="https://directory.weirdnet.org/">directory</a> (a curated catalog).
</p>

<p>
  phase 2 will bring public submissions, webrings, guestbooks, and bbs experiments — slowly and carefully.
