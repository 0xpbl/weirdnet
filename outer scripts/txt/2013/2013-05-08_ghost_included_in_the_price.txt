Hello Pablo,

"My lord," replied the Minister, "we will include the ghost in the price of the furniture. I come from a modern country, where we have everything money can buy, and with all our dynamic young compatriots conquering the Old World and carrying off its best actors and prima donnas, I conclude that if there were anything like a ghost in Europe, it would certainly already be in our country, exhibited in one of our museums or in traveling shows."

(Oscar Wilde)
