Hello Pablo,

And nothing is more exciting, lyrical, and sublime than human lard. When I see a Chico Boia, with his cordial belly, I conclude: "There goes a good one!" I distrust the thin and the elegant; while the fat of both sexes and any age give me an idea of goodness, and even of holiness.

(Nelson Rodrigues)

Warmly,
