Hello Pablo,

237 reasons to prefer the old days:

I suppose foreigners don't enjoy our food any more than we enjoy theirs. It's no surprise, since taste is formed, not something you're born with. I can praise my menu until I can't take it anymore, but a Scot would shake his head and ask: "Where's the blood sausage?" And the natives of the Fiji Islands would ask: "Where's the missionary?"

(Mark Twain)

All the best,
Marcos Barbxxara
