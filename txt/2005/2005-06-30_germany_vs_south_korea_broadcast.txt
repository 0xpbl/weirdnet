Hello Pablo,

Germany vs South Korea

"The ball is with Stefan Effenberg, what a player Stefan Effenberg... excellent Effenberg."
And then: "Ladies and gentlemen, Germany makes a substitution. Stefan Effenberg comes on."
Awkward silence.
Wheat flour ad: Haz de Oros. "It goes far, it goes far, it goeees far, what a pleasure!"

Cheers,
