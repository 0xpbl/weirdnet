Hello Pablo,

"(...) and there we were, rowing like Vikings, when Michel de Montaigne decided it would be appropriate to challenge me with a riddle. Gustave Flaubert said 'a fat frog' even before the riddle was told — which caused a great commotion on the boat, which went bankrupt six minutes later." — Popular proverb

Cheers,
