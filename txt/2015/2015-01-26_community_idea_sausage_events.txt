Hello Pablo,

Name: Seven great events with sausages
Description: "Epicharmus, a Greek playwright who lived during the golden age of Sophocles and Aeschylus, wrote a comedy titled Orya ('The Sausage') around 600 BC. Since the play exists today only in fragments, we will never know exactly what the Greeks found funny about a sausage."
Motto: the same as 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' (Robert Wiene, 1920)

All the best,
Marcos Barbxxara
